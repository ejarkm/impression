# Minimal cookiecutter for Poetry, Sphinx and Streamlit 

This is a minimal setup to work with Poetry, Sphinx and Streamlit out of the box.

## How to run

Install cookiecutter if you do not have it yet:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Run at prompt and answer several questions about your new package:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/epogrebnyak/impression
```

or, equivalently:

```
cookiecutter gh:epogrebnyak/impression
```

The way you may anwser questions is similar to this:

```console
Î» cookiecutter https://github.com/epogrebnyak/impression
package_name [pkg]: foo
author_name [Evgeniy Pogrebnyak]: Gino Forchione
author_email [e.pogrebnyak@gmail.com]: keep.it.a@secret.com
```

The project from example answers above will be created at `foo` folder.

## How I test the created package

I test the created package manually, maybe there can be a clever script for that.

 Command            |  Status
:------------------:|:-------:
`poetry run pytest` | ok
`just docs`         | needs [```poetry install```](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/impression/issues/2)
`just show`         | ok
`just app`          | ok

## Ideas for other features

- badges (streamlit, test results)
- Read the docs compatibility 
- git init and set origin in the script
- command line wrapper
